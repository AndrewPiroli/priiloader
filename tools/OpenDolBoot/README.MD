# What is OpenDolBoot #
OpenDolBoot is a tool that injects a NANDLoader into a .dol binary making them a fully bootable .app.  
These .app files can be used in custom titles/channels or be used to replace title binaries. 
  
On The Wii these are fully functional, and the tool is used by Priiloader to make itself bootable for System Menu.  
On vWii these **ONLY work with channels**. you can **NOT** replace ancast image binaries in channels (like System Menu) with these but work with all other channels (forwarders, homebrew channel, games, ...)
